Inspired by the Rhythm Roulette series by Mass Appeal

The basic concept is to present a user with 3 'records' and have them make a sampled beat

At some point it would be fun to set up a backend and allow for users to share what they've made but just sticking with frontend for now.

The MVP is complete and this project is usable, things I would like to do moving forward:
- Dive more into tailwind css and come up with a nice layout/design
- Allow users to adjust search query in a way that would still allow for max randomness
- Error handling/dealing with edge cases
- Build a backend and allow users to upload finished beats with the video that it was sampled from
